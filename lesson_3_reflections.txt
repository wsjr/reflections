1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Yes

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To avoid pulling broken commits that were accidentally pushed to the remote repository.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is for duplicating a repo in GitHub.
Clone is for duplicating a repo from GitHub to local or from local to local.
Branch is duplicating a parent branch in the local repo.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can work easily diff your local branch to the last know state of the remote branch even without internet connection.
